# Recapify
A pet project that I work on in my free-time.

The idea for the project is to create Spotify Wrapped cards for data typically excluded from Spotify's version.

### Changes coming
I am adjusting the scope by shifting from Python-based implementation with SQLite queries to a Node.js-based approach that interacts directly with the JSON files. [Test specifications](https://github.com/ejshakman/recapify/wiki/Test-Specifications) and technologies will be adjusted accordingly.
